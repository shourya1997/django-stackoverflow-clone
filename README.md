# Answerly

This is a simple Django 2.0+ project. Here I build a Stack Overflow clone called Answerly. Users can register for Answerly and will be able to ask and answer questions. A question's asker will also be able to accept answers to mark them useful and search similar type of questions.

## Features

- Django 2.0+
- Uses [Pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv) - the officially recommended Python packaging tool from Python.org.
- Development, Staging and Production settings with [django-configurations](https://django-configurations.readthedocs.org).
- PostgreSQL database support with psycopg2.
- Using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for finding answers. 
- For testing, Django integration tests, Selenium integration tests and [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.0/) has been used.
- Deploying project using Apache, mod_wsgi in Docker.

## How to install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shourya1997/django-stackoverflow-clone

# create python virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv myenv
$ source myenv/bin/activate

# -- developement requirements file
$ pip install -r requirements.development.txt

# -- production requirements file
$ pip install -r requirements.production.txt

```

## How to run

Set the Environment variables in *Apache/localhost* (where ever you are deploying) mentioned in [answerly.ini](answerly.ini) and then run the following.

```bash

# -- common settings
$ python manage.py runserver --settings=config.common_settings 

# -- developement settings
$ python manage.py runserver --settings=config.dev_settings

# -- production settings
$ python manage.py runserver --settings=config.production_settings

```

## Deployment

It is possible to deploy to Heroku/EC2 or to your own server. We will set all the services through docker containers and bind the ports to localhost of every service.

### Docker 

```bash
# Run Apache and bind to localhost port 80
$ sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 httpd 

# Pull Elasticsearch and bind to localhost: 9200 and 9300
$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.4.2
$ docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.4.2 

# Pull postrgeSQL and bind to localhost: 5432
## stop local postgres if port already in use or stop conatiner which is might be using the port
$ sudo docker run -d -p 5432:5432 postgres:12.1

# Getting inside container
$ sudo docker exec -it <container id> bash

# Install packages in Apache Docker
$ apt install -y $(cat answerly/ubuntu/packages.txt)

# Set Postgres permissions in Postgres contaniner
$ bash postgres/make_database.sh

# IP address of docker container 
$ sudo docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <container ID>

# Commit container with required libraries
$ sudo docker commit <container NAMES> <NEW Container NAME>:<TAG>

# Collect static
$ python3 manage.py collectstatic --settings=config.production_settings --no-input   
```

TODO: Make DOCKERFILE for the above process.
